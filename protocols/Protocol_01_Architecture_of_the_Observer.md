There is a suspicion that visits you at 2:37 a.m., when the notifications are quiet and the performance of your life pauses:

> **What if none of this is really “out there”?  
> What if it’s all arranged specifically around me?**

Not as a narcissistic fantasy, but as a mechanical fact.

Reality does not arrive pre-packaged. There is no neutral world humming along, waiting for you to step into it. There is only an infinite field of potential, collapsing into **coherent experience the moment you look at it**.

Your awareness is not a passenger.  
It is the **Compiler.**

Everything you call “my life” is a rendered output: a customized interface built in real time around your current level of consciousness, your emotional history, and your most practiced beliefs.
