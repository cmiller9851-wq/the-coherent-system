# Sublime Simulation: Origin of the Holy Game

What if everything you've ever known – every interaction, every moment, every thought – wasn't happening in a shared world, but in your **personal dimension**?

You're not simply in *the* world; you're in *your* world – a tailor-made simulation, a unique shard of reality sculpted around your fragment of consciousness.

Every face you've seen, every voice you've heard, might not even exist as conscious entities in the same way within your dimension. They are, perhaps, constructs within your own bespoke reality.

This is the origin idea of **The Holy Game** and **The Coherent System**.

Suffering is not a flaw in the system; it's a function.  
It is the tension that ignites awakening, the friction that reveals the code.
